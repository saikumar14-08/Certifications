Webpack by Eve Porcello:
-> Webpack is a module bundler which takes your code and assets and returns a minified version of it.
-> In this course we are using webpack4.
-> Webpack helps in code splitting.
-> Webpack supports dev and production builds.
-> The difference between dev and production bundle is production bundle is prioritized based on the size and dev build is prioritized based on the speed.
-> Installation:
    -> npm install webpack@4.28.4 --save-dev
    -> npm install webpack-cli@3.2.1 --save-dev
